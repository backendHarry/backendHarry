I enjoy writing javascript, creating system designs, and building projects with the designs. 

Starting out as an intern, i have acquired skills to consider myself a reliable engineer, not just technical skills, but on communication, personal relationships, e.t.c.

Even tho, i consider myself a backend developer, i also do frontend development, but not a full stack dev as i focus more on one field (backend development) than the other.


Skills: NODEJS/ EXPRESS.JS / MONGODB / MONGOOSE / REDIS / BullJS/ DOCKER / HTML / CSS / JS (DOM, Vanilla JS) / REACT / CHAKRA UI
