I enjoy writing javascript, creating system designs, and building projects with the designs thought of. Starting out as an intern at Tribinnov Africa, i have acquired skills to consider myself a reliable engineer, not just on technical skills, but on communication, relationships, e.t.c.
Even tho, i consider myself a backend developer, i also do frontend development, but focus more on one field (backend development) than the other and one of my goals par tech is concerned is to be a world class engineer and hopefully hold a CTO position in future.

Skills: NODEJS/ EXPRESS.JS / MONGODB / MONGOOSE / REDIS / BullJS/ DOCKER / HTML / CSS / JS (DOM, Vanilla JS) / REACT / CHAKRA UI, e.t.c

Learning in public at https://twitter.com/backendHarry/ and https://medium.com/@backendharry.
